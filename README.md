#READ_ME_PLZ

This is a repository of homebrewed PowerShell scripts by JORT. Most of these are tailored towards my homelab needs, but I have tried where I can to write "portable-enough" code for you to pull down and use yourself. If you have suggestions, please feel free to reach out as well; this is one of my earlier repos and I can use all the advice available.

Currently it is divided into:
> **Fun Learning** -- relatively 'useless' scripts written while Learning**

> **Production** -- Running on my home systems, configured manually when installed to local machines.

I will have breakdowns & explanations for some of these on my website as well (https://jorts.tech/posts), and if you're here from the website, then thank you for coming!

Hope you have a great day
